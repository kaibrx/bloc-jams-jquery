Bloc Jams is a starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app that emplored the use of jQuery methods. The purpose of the project was to code a music player.

By the end of the project I was able to:
> * Analyze an existing codebase
> * Understand the process of accessing data in JavaScript objects and inserting it into DOM elements
> * Recognize and use jQuery methods
> * Translate pseudocode into JavaScript
> * Write a function that implements complex application behavior
> * Use .indexOf() method to retreive the index of a matching array item.
> * Work with range inputs
> * Create event handler's with JQuery's .on() method
> * Use setInterval to execute code at regular intervals
> * Calculate a percentage from two values and apply the percentage to a range input
> * Use jQuery's .val() mehod to update range input values
